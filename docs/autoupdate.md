# Autoupdate automation

How an upstream release becomes a bumped manifest, with no human running `scoop update`.

## The problem this closes

`scoop update <app>` compares the installed version to the manifest without
re-deriving it from upstream, so if nothing rewrites `bucket/*.json` every client
calls its pinned version "latest" forever, as `ward` did at `0.353.0` (scoop-bucket#1).

## Push is the normal path, this job is the backstop

Each upstream renders its own manifest, publishes it as a release asset, and its
release CI pushes that file here. The hourly job exists for when that push stops
without anyone noticing. [`update-manifests.mjs`](../scripts/update-manifests.mjs)
reads [`autoupdate-sources.json`](../scripts/autoupdate-sources.json), follows
each `checkver` feed, and writes upstream's manifest **bytes** at the newest
usable release. It re-derives nothing: a second renderer would drift from the
repo owning the shape, and keeping that pull config beside the script rather than
inside `bucket/*.json` is what keeps each manifest byte-identical to upstream's.
The checkout pins `ref: main`, since a schedule runs at the sha it registered on.
It takes `CI_RELEASE_TOKEN` to push as coilyco-ops, since the Actions token is
virtual uid -2 and protected `main` 500s on it (teable:coilyco/scoop-bucket#8762).

## What makes a release usable

The manifest asset must parse, its `version` must equal its tag, and every asset
named in it that `SHA256SUMS` covers must carry the digest upstream vouches for,
reaching the `pre_install` hashes `aos` keeps outside `architecture`. One release
failing that is one still uploading, so the bucket lags a cycle. Three in a row is
a broken upstream, reported with a non-zero exit.

Quiet failures get the same treatment: a deleted upstream 404s its feed and a
`checkver` regex can match nothing, both named rather than read as current.
`agentic-os` runs three trains through one feed, so `aos.json` anchors to `aos-v`.
